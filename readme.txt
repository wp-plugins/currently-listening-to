Adds a short line at the bottom of posts/pages using custom fields to tell the world what your listening to.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can use custom fields to tell your readers what you are listening to while you write your posts/pages. Any post/page with a song or artist set in the custom fields will show what you are listening to, and if you have no fields set it will be as if you have no plugin at all (no ugly half empty lines!).

Through the admin page you can customize the look of the plugin. You can change the default "Currently listening to" to whatever you want, as well as the separator between the text and your song/artist. There are also custom style options you can set, including bolding the song/artist name. 

Available Custom Fields:
* CLT_song - Song name
* CLT_artist - Artist name
* CLT_text - If you want to have a special text instead of your own default text you can do so here. Normally your posts say "Currently listening to" and on special occasions you can say "Celebrating to" or "Rockin out to"

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In your posts set custom fields for the song and/or artist you are listening to. CLT_song and CLT_artist (respectively).

Note: You can set only one if you would like, the output will change based on if you have a song, artist, or both added.
